# Fractal - Teste TÃ©cnico
#### This project aims to develop a React app responsible for consuming the API: https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2, following the prerequisites of the test.

## Installation
#### Make sure you have the same version of Node as mine to avoid compatibility errors.

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs 
sudo apt install npm
```
#### Afterward, use NVM to select version 18.13.0 for this project.
```bash
nvm use 18.13.0
```

## Usage
To initialize the project, use NPM to download all the necessary dependencies for the project to run.

```bash
npm
```
Afterward, use the start script:

```bash
npm start
```
## Contributing
The focus of this project is only to implement the GET consumption of the Punk API. After the Fractal evaluation, my goal is to evolve this project to become a wiki of the Punk API beer. We welcome pull requests. For significant changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

#### Tests have not been implemented at the moment, as I do not possess the technical capabilities to run all the necessary tests to ensure the application is 100% tested.
